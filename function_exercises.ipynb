    "The string 'ABC' is passed to the function and the output variable is initialized.  We then start a loop that goes from 1 to 3, the number of characters in the column name.  In the first loop the last letter 'C' is selected and made uppercase.  We then get the ordinal value of the character which is 67, and subtract 64 to get the cypher value 3.  That 3 is then added to the output.  The if loop is not executed because i is not greater than 1.  On the next loop i is 2 so we get the second to last character 'B' and make it uppercase.  We get the ordinal value 66 and subtract 64 to get the cypher value 2 which is added to the output.  The if evaluates as true, and we add 25 to the output to account for this being the next digit in a base-26 counting system.  The process continues using the 'A', getting the cypher value 1 and adding it to the output, as well as another 25 for the third digit in the base-25 counting system. Now that all digits were tested the output is returned as the column index number."
